        To be made whole or saved is to submit to God and His plan and purpose
        for our lives. It is a turning from our old ways and turning to Jesus,
        to ask Him for the forgiveness of our sins and to give us new life in
        Him. Romans 10:9 says: “If you declare with your mouth that Jesus is
        Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you
        will be saved.”
      </p>
      <p className="py-1">
        Salvation is God&lsquo;s free gift to us and we become His children. It
        is an irrevocable acceptance into the family of God and empowerment to
        live a life wholly and fully with the purpose of reflecting God to the
        rest of His creation. If you are not sure whether you are right with God
        or you know in fact that you need Jesus in your life, you can choose to
        follow Him right now by praying a prayer of surrender to Jesus. The
        Bible says in Romans 10:13 “For whosoever shall call upon the name of
        the Lord shall be saved.”
      </p>
      <p className="py-1">
        Dear Jesus, I&lsquo;m praying because I know I have done wrong by living
        without You. I am sorry and I trust that You will forgive me. I accept
        Your love and grace for me and ask that You would be my Lord. Help me
        believe in You and love You every day, and help me to show the world
        what You are like and how great Your love is. In Jesus&lsquo; name,
        Amen.
